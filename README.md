# ERC-6551 (token bound account) Demo

## Overview
This project consists of Solidity smart contracts designed to implement ERC6551 token-bound accounts on the Arbitrum Sepolia network. The core components include the ERC6551 registry, ERC6551 Simple Account Implementation, and a test ERC721 contract named ScalingETHNFT. All contracts have been deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia network and are verified.

## Usage
The primary functionality demonstrated by this project is the creation of token-bound accounts associated with ERC721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Below is a high-level overview of the process:

## Minting an NFT:
Users can mint an NFT through the ScalingETHNFT contract which is an ERC-721 contract

### Creating a Token Bound Account:
After minting an NFT, users can create a token-bound account that is associated with the newly minted NFT.
This association is established using the ERC6551 standard, ensuring that the account is bound to the specific NFT.

## Demo Video
A demo video showcasing the process of minting an NFT and creating a token-bound account associated with it is available here.
